## Coding Exercises in C#

Coding exercises, using C# 8.0 as the primary language. This is mostly for interview prep, and to try to stay sharp on fundamental concepts.

Broadly speaking, my objective is to cover the following categories:

- Arrays & Strings
- Hash Tables (in C#, Dictionary<TKey, TValue>)
- Linked Lists
- Stacks & Queues
- Trees
- Graphs
- Recursion
- Dynamic Programming Techniques
- Etc.

There isn't a straight line through these topics for me. I have been blending them as I go, and I often circle back to additional exercises in earlier categories before continuing forward. It will seem a bit unstructured to an outside observer.

Currently using Google Gemini (2.5 Pro) to source these exercises and provide feedback on my solutions.
