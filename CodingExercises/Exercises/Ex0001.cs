Problem: Find First Non-Repeating Character

Description:
Write a method that takes a string as input and finds the first character that does not repeat anywhere else in the string. The method should be case-sensitive (i.e., 'a' and 'A' are considered different characters). If all characters repeat or the string is empty, return the null character '\0'.
